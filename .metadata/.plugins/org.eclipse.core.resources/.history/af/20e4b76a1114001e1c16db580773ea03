	 *  ------------- static ----------------
	 *  
	 *  -> static is used for the memory management.
	 *  -> only one static variable for the each class.
	 *  -> it is used when there is a common value
	 *  -> it is called through class name i.e if we have class name "Area" then we can call using " Area. ".
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  ----------- Java Static method ----------
	 *  -> static method belongs to class
	 *  
	 *  // restriction for static method 
	 *  -> static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly
	 *  -> so this can be used through " object ".
	 *   
	 *  -> "this" and "super"  cannot be used in static context
	 *
