	 * ---------------- Abstraction ------------
	 * # process of hiding implementation details in the program.
	 * # to achieve abstraction :
	 * 	a> Abstract class:
	 * 		# class which contains abstract(unimplemented methods) and non abstract(implemented methods) methods is known as abstract class.
	 * 				
	 * 			# Abstract method :
	 *			-> method which does not have implementation/ body.
	 *				e.g.
	 *					abstract void add();
	 *					abstract int area(int l, int b);
	 *
	 *		# we can't create object of abstract class.
	 *		# every abstract must have at least one child class and child class must override abstract method.
	 *		# level of abstraction 0 - 100%.
	 *
	 *		syntax:
	 *			
	 *			abstract class_name{
	 *				// abstract methods
	 *
	 *				// non abstarct methods
	 *
	 *                    }
	 * 	b> Interface:
	 * 	# same as class which contains public abstract method and public static final variables.
